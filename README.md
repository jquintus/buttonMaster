# buttonMaster

The code running the box of buttons on my desktop.


This is running on the [Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062). To make it work you'll want to download the latest build of [Circuit Python](https://circuitpython.org/board/feather_nrf52840_express/)

## Debugging

For help debugging, see my blog post about using [Circuit Python](https://quintussential.com/archive/2020/06/14/Day-11-Progress-with-Circuit-Python/).
